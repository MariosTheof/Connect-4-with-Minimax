# Connect-4-with-Minimax

A classic Connect 4 game I made for a university assignment. 

You can play against the computer AI, using the cmd. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to decide its next move.

You can run it, just by compiling and running main.

In order to change the game difficulty, just edit "int maxDepth = 4;" in the "Main.java"
